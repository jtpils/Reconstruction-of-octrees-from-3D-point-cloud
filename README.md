# Reconstruction of octrees from 3D point cloud

## Objectives:

- To develop a software tool that receives a inputs a 3D point cloud and displays the corresponding 3D octrees data structure. The user can indicate the depth of the octree data structure and the minimum number of data points that stops the progression of the spliting process of each of the branches in the octree data structure.



## Outputs:

- Software tool developed in C++ (Linux environment) using the library OpenGL/GLUT. The user can specify the parameters suggested in the objectives. The source code and the documentation of this project is available here. The software tool was tested using two 3d point cloud datasets. The videos demonstrating those tests are presented next:
